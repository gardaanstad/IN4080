    " \n",
    "Mandatory assignment 1 consists of three parts. In Part 1 (6 points), you will test and improve on a BPE (Byte-Pair-Encoding) tokenizer . In Part 2 (7 points), you will estimate an N-gram language model, based on a training corpus and the tokenizer you worked on in Part 1. Finally, in Part 3 (7 points), you will develop a basic classification model to distinguish between Bokmål and Nynorsk sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should answer all three parts. You are required to get at least 12/20 points to pass. The most important is that you try to answer each question (possibly with some mistakes), to help you gain a better and more concrete understanding of the topics covered during the lectures. There are also bonus questions for those of you who would like to deepen their understanding of the topics covered by this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that you have read and are familiar with IFI’s requirements and guidelines for mandatory assignments, see [here](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-mandatory.html) and [here](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-guidelines.html).\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment. You should not deliver joint submissions. \n",
    "- You may redeliver in Devilry before the deadline (__Friday, September 12 at 23:59__), but include all files in the last delivery.\n",
    "- Only the last delivery will be read! If you deliver more than one file, put them into a zip-archive. You don't have to include in your delivery the files already provided for this assignment. \n",
    "- Name your submission _your\\_username\\_in4080\\_mandatory1_\n",
    "- You can work on this assignment either on the IFI machines or on your own computer. \n",

    "*The preferred format for the assignment is a completed version of this Jupyter notebook*, containing both your code and explanations about the steps you followed. We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have done and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",
